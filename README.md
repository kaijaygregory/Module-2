# VBA Stock Metrics

Background

For this challenge, I utilized VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data and perform the following tasks:

- Created a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

The ticker symbol

Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

The total stock volume of the stock.

- Add functionality to the script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".

- Make the appropriate adjustments to the VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.

- Used conditional formatting to highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
